# SVM Classifier with a Convolutional Autoencoder for Feature Extraction

## Software

## Description
A convolutional autoencoder was trained for data pre-processing; dimension reduction and feature extraction. Additionally, an SVM was trained for image classification and attached to the central layer of the network. Essentially, MNIST data is fed into the autoencoder, which then feeds the result into the SVM for classification.
